WS Export
=========

![CI](https://github.com/wikimedia/ws-export/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

WS Export is a tool for exporting Wikisource books to many formats, such as EPUB or PDF.
The documentation can be found here:
https://wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:WS_Export

Requirements
============
* PHP 7.3 or 7.4
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
* The `fc-list` command

Installation
============

1. Get the source code:

       git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/ws-export.git
       cd tool

2. Install dependencies:

       composer install --no-dev

   Then create a `.env.local` file.

   * In order to export to PDF, plain text, RTF, or Mobi formats
     you should also install [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com)
     so that the tool can use the `ebook-convert` command.
   * To run the integration tests (or just to validate exported ebooks)
     you should also install
     [epubcheck](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck).
     If it's not installed at `/usr/bin/epubcheck` then
     set the `EPUBCHECK_JAR` environment variable.

3. Create a mysql database and database user
   and add these details to `.env.local`.

4. Create the database with `./bin/console doctrine:database:create`

5. Run the migrations with `./bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`

6. This tool uses the [Toolforge Bundle](https://github.com/wikimedia/ToolforgeBundle), and it connects to [multiple databases](https://github.com/wikimedia/ToolforgeBundle#replicas-connection-manager).
  * Set replicas credentials in the `.env.local` file.

  * Establish an SSH tunnel to the replicas (only necessary on local environments)
```bash
$ ./bin/console toolforge:ssh
```
  * Bind address for docker enviroments
```bash
$ ./bin/console toolforge:ssh --bind-address=0.0.0.0
```

## CLI Usage

### app:check

Run epubcheck on books. With no options set, this will check 10 random books from English Wikisource. Note that the random 10 will be cached (for repeatability) unless you use <info>--nocache</info>.

    app:check [-l|--lang LANG] [--nocache] [-t|--title TITLE] [-c|--count COUNT] [-s|--namespaces NAMESPACES]

* `--lang` `-l` — Wikisource language code.
  Default: 'en'
* `--nocache` — Do not cache anything (re-fetch all data).
* `--title` `-t` — Wiki page name of a single work to check.
* `--count` `-c` — How many random pages to check. Ignored if <info>--title</info> is used.
  Default: 10
* `--namespaces` `-s` — Pipe-delimited namespace IDs. Ignored if <info>--title</info> is used.

### app:export

Export a book.

    app:export [-l|--lang LANG] [-t|--title TITLE] [-f|--format FORMAT] [-p|--path PATH] [--nocache] [--nocredits]

* `--lang` `-l` — Wikisource language code.
* `--title` `-t` — Wiki page name of the work to export. Required
* `--format` `-f` — Export format. One of: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  Default: 'epub-3'
* `--path` `-p` — Filesystem path to export to.
  Default: '[CWD]'
* `--nocache` — Do not cache anything (re-fetch all data).
* `--nocredits` — Do not include the credits list in the exported ebook.

### app:opds

Generate an OPDS file.

    app:opds [-l|--lang LANG] [-c|--category CATEGORY]

* `--lang` `-l` — Wikisource language code.
* `--category` `-c` — Category name to export.

## Tests

Run `composer install` to install dependencies required for testing.

Make sure the test database is created and migrations are up-to-date:
```bash
$ ./bin/console doctrine:database:create --env=test
$ ./bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=test --no-interaction
```

You only need to run the first command once, and the second one only
when new migrations are created.

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory, to run them:

```bash
$ ./bin/phpunit --exclude-group integration
$ ./bin/phpunit --group integration # runs integration tests (slow)
```

You can also run code linting etc. with `composer test`.

Docker Developer Environment
============================

Wikisource export can also be run for development using Docker Compose. _(beta, only tested on linux)_

The default environment provides PHP, Apache, Calibre, Epubcheck and a MariaDB database.

### Requirements

You'll need a locally running Docker and Docker Compose:

  - [Docker installation instructions][docker-install]
  - [Docker Compose installation instructions][docker-compose]

[docker-install]: https://docs.docker.com/install/
[docker-compose]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

---

### Quickstart

Modify or create `.env.local`. This config uses the database container defaults.
```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@database:3306/wsexport
```

Do the same for the test database at `.env.test.local`, but giving a different database name:
```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@database:3306/wsexport_test
```

Make sure you cd into `./docker`

```bash
cd ./docker 
```

Run the following command to add your user ID and group ID to your `.env` file:

```bash
echo "WS_DOCKER_UID=$(id -u)
WS_DOCKER_GID=$(id -g)" >> ./.env
```

Optionally, set the port in `.env` (default is 8888):
```bash
WS_EXPORT_PORT=18000
```

Start the environment and install

```bash
# -d is detached mode - runs containers in the background:
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec wsexport composer install
docker-compose exec wsexport ./bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
```

Wikisource Export should be up at http://localhost:8888/ (or the configured port)

### Cache
Go to `/refresh` to clear the cache

### Setup Xdebug
Xdebug is disabled by default. If you need to enable it you can do so via an env variable by creating a `./docker/docker-compose.override.yml` file with the following content
```
version: '3.7'
services:
  wsexport:
    environment:
     - XDEBUG_MODE=debug
```

#### Visual Studio Code

Add the following configuration to your `launch.json`
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for XDebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9000,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You need to install the [php-xdebug-ext]
